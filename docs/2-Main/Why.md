### Inclusivity and Accessibility
 - Our core belief is simple yet powerful: a decentralized internet should be inclusive, welcoming everyone into the fold. No barriers, no exclusions. It's about democratizing access and ensuring that the benefits of decentralization are shared by a diverse global community.

### User Ownership
 - Ownership matters. The decentralized internet should be owned by those who use it daily. Users should have a say, a vote, and an active role in shaping the future of the digital landscape. This belief is at the heart of our mission.
