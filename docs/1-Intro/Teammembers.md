# 👋 I'm Frank

Welcome to my digital playground where I weave code  
and creativity into web3 wonders! 👨‍💻

## About Me

- 🌐 **Web3AR Developer:**  
  Turning the ordinary into extraordinary in the vast world of web3.  
  Creating experiences that pop out of  
  your screen and into reality!

- 👕 **Shirt Enthusiast:**  
  By day, I code; by night, I'm on a mission to collect  
  the coolest shirts in the metaverse. My wardrobe is  
  a canvas, and the shirts are my pixels.

- 🚀 **Polkadot Dev Explorer:**  
  Navigating the cosmos of Polkadot, building the bridges  
  that connect the decentralized dots.
  Making the blockchain a bit more colorful, one line of code at a time.

## Fun Facts

- 🍦 **Ice Cream Aficionado:**  
  My love for coding is rivaled only by my love for ice cream!  
  Vanilla, chocolate, or a wild mix of flavors.  
  I'm always up for a scoop or two (or three).

So, if you see lines of code that taste like sprinkles  
and shirts that blink in augmented reality,  
you've probably stumbled upon my corner of the web.  
Let's make the internet a bit sweeter  
and a whole lot more whimsical together! 🌈✨

  Todd the weathered fisherman spends his days in quiet solitude, angling on the Ribbington Docks. Unbeknownst to many, he was once a great general whose campaign helped quell the Salamander Uprising. With each cast of his rod into the Sea, Todd’s memories resurface, intertwining the tranquility of the present with the guilt of his past — leaving him a silent sentinel of a time long gone.

  Bufa the Jolly, a cheerful and enterprising frog, travels the land with her her jingling cart, bringing trinkets, wares, and smiles to all she encounters. With a heartwarming ribbit and an assortment of knick-knacks, she embodies the old adage that one frog's trash is another's treasure.
