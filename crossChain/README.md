### CrossChain

> ⚠️ recieve function doesn't update votes due to last encountered issues.

- `./src` contains contracts
- `./script` contains deployments
- `./lib` contains modules
- `./broadcast` contains past deployments
- `./menu-script.sh` contains quickstart

If i have to explain it, I would say its a fancy counter.\
Instead of number we call it vote.\
Instead of intracontract its cross contract.\
Keep it simple and clear.
